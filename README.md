# semi-autonomous-ball-collecting-robot
As part of our Tinkering Lab course, our team developed a semi-autonomous robot that collects tennis balls on the court. Equipped with sensors for navigation and an efficient collection mechanism, this robot streamlines the ball collection process, making practice easier for players. Check out our repository for documentation and code!
